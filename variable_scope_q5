#Q5 What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have tried to answer.

a = "Xyzzy"

def my_value(b)
  b = 'yzzyX'
end

my_value(a)
puts a

#I believe the output of puts 'a' will be "Xyzzy" which is pointed to the local variable in line 3. 
#In this case b has been re-assigned a new value of 'yzzyX'.  In line 9 we invoke the my_value method
#and pass the local variable 'a' as an argument, this will output 'yzzyX' since a is pointed to b within the method.
